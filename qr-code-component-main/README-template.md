## My process

At first, I felt frustrated when the divs I had created wouldn't move, but then I remembered to set the white one to display: in-line block.  Things quickly began to fall into place after I figured that out.  Wow, I just looked at my repository history.  It says I uploaded the files 2 hours ago.  I didn't realize that I've been working on this for so long.  I would've guessed 1 hour.  And I'm only part of the way done at this point.  I have completed the mobile version.  I still need to do the desktop version.  I'll save that for another time, upload another screenshot, and  write an update here once it is done.

### Built with

### What I learned

Interestingly, I learned something not directly related to the challenge--I learned more about how to use Git Hub!  Editing this Read Me file did not come easy for me.  I didn't understand how to post the link to the screenshots,  how to add code snippets, or add hyperlinks at first, but reading through the Frontend Mentor directions and some research at the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#images) helped me to learn markdown syntax.  Here is another great resource recommended by Frontend Mentor: [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)  I am learning the importance and power of good research while coding. I did also look up some other things, such as border-radius:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  border-radius: 5%;
 }
 ```
